## Configuration file for EcoLight/HydroLight
#
## Values list:
# iop:          flag for optical(1) or geometric(0) depth in meters.
# nznom:        is the number of depths where output is desired (auto-calculated)
# zetanom:      are the depths (max 100 values) where output is desired. zetanom (1) = 0.0, ..., zetanom (nznom) = zmax
# chl:          chlorophyll concentration (mg/m^3).
#               values: constant value [0.50], or argument with name of file within pairs of depth and Chl values
# cdom:         cdom concentration (gm/m^3).
#               values: constant value [0.50], or argument with name of file within pairs of depth and CDOM values
# mineral:      mineral concentration (gm/m^3).
#               values: constant value [0.50], or argument with name of file within pairs of depth and mineral values
# ibotm:        is a flag for the type of bottom boundary.
#               ibotm = 0 (water column is infinitely deep)
#               ibotm = 1 (the bottom is an opaque Lambertian reflecting surface located at depth zmax. The irradiance
#                       reflectance of the bottom is taken to be 0 <= rflbot <= 1
#               ibotm = 2 (the bottom is an opaque Lambertian reflecting surface located at depth zmax. The
#                       wavelength-dependent irradiance reflectance of the bottom will be read from a HE52 standard
#                       format file of bottom reflectance data.
# rflbot:       irradiance reflectance of the bottom, is always read, but is used only if ibotm = 1.
# RbottomFile:  standard-format bottom reflectance data file (read by routine rbottom). Files:
#               "dummyR.bot", "avg_clean_seagrass.txt", "avg_coral.txt", "avg_dark_sediment.txt", "avg_hardpan.txt",
#               "avg_kelp.txt", "avg_macrophyte.txt", "avg_ooid_sand.txt", "avg_seagrass.txt", "avg_turf_algae.txt",
#               "brown_algae.txt", "coral_sand.txt", "green_algae.txt", "red_algae.txt"
#               all bottom files -> RbottomFile = "*"
#               some bottom files -> RbottomFile = "dummyR.bot", "avg_dark_sediment.txt", "avg_macrophyte.txt",
# cloud:        is the cloud cover, 0.0 (clear sky) <= cloud <= 1.0 (solid overcast)
# suntheta:     is the solar zenith angle in degrees, 0.0 (sun at the zenith) <= suntheta <= 90.0 (sun at the horizon)
# windspd:      wind speed in meters per second at an anemometer height of 12 m.
# temp:         the water temperature
in deg C, 0.0 <= temp <= 40.0
# salinity:     the salinity in PSU, 0.0 <= salinity <= 100
#
## How to enter values:
#
# 1.- Uncomment line of variable
#
# 2.- Specify values after equals (=)
#   2.1.- Array of values using brackets separated by spaces
#   [0.00 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00]
#
#   2.2.- A range of values using minimum value, maximum value and step without brackets separated by spaces
#   0 1 0.20
